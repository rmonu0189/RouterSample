# RouterSample

This repository demonstrates how to implement a custom routing system in SwiftUI using NavigationPath and a Router class, providing a clean and modular approach to navigation in iOS 16 and later.

## Overview

SwiftUI's NavigationPath offers a flexible way to manage navigation stacks programmatically. By integrating a Router class that conforms to the ObservableObject protocol, you can centralize navigation logic, making it easier to handle complex navigation flows, including presenting sheets and full-screen covers.

## Features

Programmatic Navigation: Navigate between views using the Router class without relying solely on NavigationLink.
State Management: The Router class, as an ObservableObject, allows for reactive UI updates in response to navigation state changes.
Modal Presentations: Support for presenting sheets and full-screen covers through the router.
